## What are we actually doing?

A regular (monthly) meeting, centered around R

Topics will include: 

- Introduction to R
- Mentoring (matching up experienced users and beginners, people new to industry and senior folks)
- Discussion of specific packages and tools (such as tidyverse, shiny, ggplot2, RMarkdown)
- Tutorials (e.g., on visualization principles and techniques, data wrangling, analysis techniques)



## Who

Organized by Page Piccinini (NPI), Christina Bergmann (LSCP), and Diane Beldame (ThinkR)

Currently about 60 members

You are invited, too, independent of your gender identity. Really! Men can come, as long as a member who is also there vouches for them. 


## How

Join the meetup.com group and RSVP to the meetings that interest you. 

Note, there is a code of conduct. Yes, it's necessary.
